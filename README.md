Introducing a small app that can make the job of a **train engineer** easier! When you park your car, you always put the brake on, right? Similarly, a train driver also needs to put the brakes on the train, but it's not an easy task, especially when dealing with a train weighing up to 2500 tonnes. The engineer must calculate the train's weight and the angle of the rails before applying the parking brake. This means that the engineer has to walk along the train and pull a number of brakes on some wagons.

However, there are wagons that don't have parking brakes, which can be a challenge. In this case, the engineer must find out how many axles the train has, check the rail angle again, and then apply special brakes on the wheels of those wagons. This can be a time-consuming and challenging task, especially when you have to deal with a large number of wagons.

This is where our small app can help! With just a few clicks, the app can calculate the weight of the train, the rail angle, and the number of wagons that require special brakes. The app can also suggest the type of brakes that should be applied on each wagon, making the job of the train engineer much easier and faster.

In summary, our small app can save train engineers valuable time and effort while ensuring the safety of the train and its passengers. Try it out today!

## Solution 
As you can see, train parking can be a complicated task, but we've got you covered! We've developed an app that simplifies the process and makes it easy for train drivers to calculate all the necessary parameters.

With our app, train drivers only need to input the train data, and the app takes care of the rest. It calculates the weight of the train, the angle of the rails, and even determines the number of wagons that require special brakes. This saves train drivers valuable time and effort while ensuring that the train is parked safely and efficiently.

Moreover, our app helps companies save money by making this operation faster and more streamlined. With fewer errors and quicker parking times, companies can optimize their operations, improve **efficiency**, and **reduce the risk** of accidents.

In conclusion, our app is a simple yet powerful tool that can help train drivers park their trains safely and quickly while helping companies save time and money. Try it out today and experience the benefits for yourself!
