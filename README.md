Small app to make **Train Enginier** job easy. If you park your car, you put the brake on(or you should). The same way does a train driver, but it's not that easy with
a train that is up to 2500 tonnen. He has to calculate train weight and rails angle so he can put the train in "park break". That means that he should walk along the
train and pull a number of breaks on some wagons. But there are wagons that do not have "park breaks", what should he do in this case? Now he has to find out how many
axles does the train have and again check the rail angle and with that he has to put some special braks on the wheels.

## Solution 
Like you see things can get complicated. So i made this app to make it easier to calculate all of these. The train driver should type the train data and this app 
will calculate everything for him. This make it easy for him, and with that we help Companies by making this oparation faster and save money.
